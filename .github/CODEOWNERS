# Please once you will have some ownership of some package/module, you can add
# it here to be requested for review of comming PRs which are changing the code
# you own.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
#*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2
# We have nested team under OCS-QE team for top level reviewers, so everyone
# who is part of this team will be requested for revew for upcomming PRs for
# all changes.
*   @red-hat-storage/top-level-reviewers

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
#*.js    @js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
