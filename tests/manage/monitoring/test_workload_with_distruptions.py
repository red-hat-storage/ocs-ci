"""
Test cases test_workload_with_checksum and test_workload_with_checksum_verify
were originaly proposed for testing metrics and (partial) cluster shutdown, but
they can be used for any other test which needs to verify that cluster still
preserves data written before some cluster wide distruption like shutdown,
reboot or upgrade.

The basic idea is 1st test deploys a k8s job which writes data on OCS based PV
using fio along with a checksum file, and then the 2nd test verifies that the
data are still there on the PV. For this to work, the PV created during the 1st
test needs to be preserved.

The data are written on a PV via workload_storageutilization_checksum_rbd
fixture, used in test_workload_with_checksum. When the writing finishes, the
checksum is computed and stored along with the data, and finally reclaim policy
of the PV is changed to Retain, so that the PV survives teardwon of the test.
The PV is labeled as ``fixture=workload_storageutilization_checksum_rbd`` so
that the verification test can identify and reuse it.

After the first test finishes, the PV is in Released state and won't be reused,
because it contains claimRef referencing the original PVC.

The test_workload_with_checksum_verify locates the PV created by
test_workload_with_checksum via the label, and then removes it's claimRef so
that the PV changes it's state to Available. The test asks for the PV using PVC
with the same parameters, and executes the checksum verification.

The original idea was to use fio verification feature, but testing showed that
when this fails for some reason or gets stuck, it's hard to debug.
