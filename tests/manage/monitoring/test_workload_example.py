"""
This is a demonstration how to start k8s Job in one test, let it running, and
then revisit it and stop in another one. Original simple draft was created by
mbukatov based on discussion with fbalak, who is expected to tweak it further
to fit into the upgrade scenario (as well as error checking adn logging).
