# Functional Testing
Tests that are focused on one particular component or functionality of ODF will belong in the Functional module.

An example of this kind of testing is our [mcg](https://github.com/red-hat-storage/ocs-ci/tree/master/tests/manage/mcg) testing. This module is aimed at testing one ODF component (MCG) and all of the tests in this module are aimed at testing one particular feature of that component (bucket_creation, multi_region, object_versioning, etc.).
