# This yaml file contains the configuration for the deployment of the ACM hub cluster on IBM Cloud Bare Metal
# with Hosted client clusters. The configuration is used by the HyperShiftBase.download_hcp_binary(),
# HostedClients.deploy_hosted_ocp_clusters(), HypershiftHostedOCP.deploy_ocp(), HostedODF.do_deploy(),
# MetallbOperator.deploy_metallb() and similar methods during the Hosted clusters deployment.
# The configuration is for observation purposes only and is not intended to be executed. In order to execute
# the configuration, the user must provide the desired values for the variables in the configuration.
