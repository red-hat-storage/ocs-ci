# This is example of the config for deployment which allows you to overwrite
# the default values from templates.

# In default section you can overwrite data which will be then exposed to all
# configs like ocsci/default_config.yaml. As you can see we are using there
# default ENV_DATA section and you can see for example:
# ceph_image: '{{ DEFAULTS["CEPH_IMAGE"] }}' which means is take by default
# from DEFAULTS section from CEPH_IMAGE variable define in this section.
DEFAULTS:
  CEPH_IMAGE: "quay.io/rhceph-dev/rhceph-4.0-rhel-8"
  # this will be used in ENV_DATA section as well cause of example mentioned
  # above!

ENV_DATA:
  # take a look at deployment templates variables, here you is the place you
  # can overwrite all the vars you want.
  platform: 'aws'
  worker_replicas: 6  # here you can define diff number of workers
  master_replicas: 3  # no effect here as default is also 3
  # you can overwrite default rook image right here. But you will redefine it
  # just for ENV_DATA section. PPL who will access this ROOK Image from
  # ocs/defaults.py will still get default one from ocsci/default_config.yaml
  # from it's DEFAULTS section.
  rook_image: "quay.io/rhceph-dev/rook"

  # We don't define ceph_image: here so it will be taken from
  # ocsci/default_config.yaml and as you can see from DEFAULTS which we
  # re-defining in DEFAULTS section above.
