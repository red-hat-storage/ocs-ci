# Fusion and Fusion Data Foundation

## Requirements

Fusion deployments require an OCP cluster.

FDF deployments require an OCP cluster with Fusion deployed.

In addition to the typical ocs-ci requirements for execution, we also require [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md#installing-skopeo) for retrieving image data from the pre-release registry.

## Fusion

We support the deployment of Fusion on top of OCP deployments by using the `deploy-fusion` entry-point. You can see more info about this entry-point with `deploy-fusion --help`.

You can deploy Fusion with the following command:

`deploy-fusion --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME --cluster-path CLUSTER_PATH`

Note these are the same `CLUSTER_NAME` and `CLUSTER_PATH` you passed to `run-ci` to deploy OCP.

By default this will deploy the latest supported GA version of Fusion.

For pre-release versions of Fusion, you can use the same command with an additional config for the version you wish to install.

```
deploy-fusion --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME --cluster-path CLUSTER_PATH --conf ocs_ci/framework/conf/fusion_version/fusion-2.8.yaml
```

## Fusion Data Foundation

We also support the deployment of Fusion Data Foundation as an alternative to ODF when Fusion is installed. Similar to Fusion there is an entry-point created for FDF deployments, `deploy-fdf`. You can see more info about this entry-point with `deploy-fdf --help`.

You can deploy FDF with the following command:

`deploy-fdf --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME --cluster-path CLUSTER_PATH`

Note these are the same `CLUSTER_NAME` and `CLUSTER_PATH` you passed to `run-ci` to deploy OCP.

By default this will deploy the latest supported GA version of FDF.

For pre-release versions of FDF, you can use the same command with an additional config for the version you wish to install.

```
deploy-fdf --cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME --cluster-path CLUSTER_PATH --conf ocs_ci/framework/conf/fdf_version/fdf-4.18.yaml
```
