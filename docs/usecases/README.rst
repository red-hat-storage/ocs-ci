=========================
 Common Usecases and FAQ
=========================

This directory contains doc files with description of common use cases or
answers for frequently asked questions about ``ocs-ci`` usage.

To add new use case/faq entry, just commit new markdown_ or rst_ file in this
directory, Sphinx_ will then include it in table of contents automatically
(this is done via ``glob`` option of `sphinx toctree directive`_ used in
`index.rst <index.rst>`_ file).

.. _`sphinx toctree directive`: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree
