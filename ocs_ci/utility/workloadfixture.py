    Get dictionary with keys 'start', 'stop', 'metadata' and 'result' that
    contain information about start and stop time of given function and its
    result.

    Args:
        operation (function): Function to be performed
        result_file (str): File name that should contain measurement results
            including logs in json format. If this file exists then it is
            used for test. Existing file is ignored when
            config.RUN["ignore_next_measurement_file"] is set.
        minimal_time (int): Minimal number of seconds to monitor a system.
            If provided then monitoring of system continues even when
            operation is finshed. If not specified then measurement is finished
            when operation is complete
        metadata (dict): This can contain dictionary object with information
            relevant to test (e.g. volume name, operating host, ...)
        measure_after (bool): Determine if time measurement is done before or
            after the operation returns its state. This can be useful e.g.
            for capacity utilization testing where operation fills capacity
            and utilized data are measured after the utilization is completed
        pagerduty_service_ids (list): Service IDs from PagerDuty system used
            incidents query
        threading_lock (threading.RLock): Lock used for synchronization of the
            threads in Prometheus calls

    Returns:
        dict: contains information about `start` and `stop` time of given
            function and its `result` and provided `metadata`
            Example::
