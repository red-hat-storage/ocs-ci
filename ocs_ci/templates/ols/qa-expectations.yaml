  question: "What is ODF?"
  expected_answer: >
    ODF stands for OpenShift Data Foundation. It is a suite of storage and data management solutions designed for OpenShift, a container application platform. The OpenShift Data Foundation operator, also known as the odf-operator, plays a key role in managing and integrating various storage systems within the OpenShift ecosystem.
    The odf-operator acts as a "meta" operator, influencing other operators to provide a unified data management experience. It does not provide data storage or services itself but rather serves as an integration and management layer for other storage systems.
    In essence, OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) aims to simplify data management for containerized applications running on OpenShift, providing a flexible and scalable storage solution.

  question: "What are the minimum hardware requirements for deploying an ODF internal cluster?"
  expected_answer: >
    According to the provided documentation, the minimum hardware requirements for deploying an OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) internal cluster are:
    24 CPU (logical)
    72 GiB memory
    3 storage devices
    Additionally, for a 3-node cluster in an internal mode deployment with a single device set, a minimum of 3 x 10 = 30 units of CPU are required.
    It's also important to note that the number of local storage devices that can run per node is a function of the node size and resource requirements, and expanding the cluster in multiples of three, one node in each failure domain, is an easy way to satisfy pod placement rules.
  required_terms:
    - 24 CPU
    - 72 Gib memory

  question: "How can I enable volume encryption for PVCs in ODF?"
  expected_answer: >
    To enable volume encryption for PVCs in OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF), you need to create a storage class with encryption enabled. Here are the general steps:
    1. Create a Key Management System (KMS): You need to have a KMS, such as HashiCorp Vault or Thales CipherTrust Manager, to store and manage the encryption keys.
    2. Configure access to the KMS: You need to configure access to the KMS before creating the storage class.
    3. Create a storage class with encryption enabled: You can create a storage class with encryption enabled using an external KMS. You need to specify the KMS details in the storage class configuration.
    Note that persistent volume encryption is only available for RBD (RADOS Block Device) PVs. Also, you need to have a valid Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Advanced subscription to use this feature.
    Once you have created a storage class with encryption enabled, you can use it to create PVCs with encrypted volumes.
