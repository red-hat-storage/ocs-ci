# Fio directory

In this directory are stored configuration files and artefacts related to Fio.

## Files format

Fio usage is currently not unified across the framework so there are
configuration files with `.fio` extension in `Fio INI` format and there are
also `.yaml` files containing Fio options in `YAML` format.
